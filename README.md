# Yehoshua Focus

Yehoshua Focus is a personal thinking operating system designed to help clarify attention, structure thought, and support deliberate decision-making.

This project follows the principle of dogfooding: it is built first for personal daily use, to solve a real and recurring problem — lack of focus, scattered thinking, and unclear priorities.

The MVP is powered by Trigger.dev for scheduled check-ins and Resend for email-based reflection.

## Mission

Help decide where attention should be invested — today, this week, and over the long term.

Yehoshua Focus is not about doing more.  
It is about doing fewer things, with clarity and intention.

---

## What Yehoshua Focus Is

- A personal **Thinking OS**
- A system for attention alignment
- A structured space for reflection and decision
- A set of recurring cognitive check-ins

## What It Is Not

- A task manager
- A productivity hack
- A calendar replacement
- A note-taking app

---

## Core Concept

Yehoshua Focus operates through **daily and weekly check-ins** that act as a cognitive mirror.

Instead of tracking tasks, it asks the right questions at the right moments.

---

## MVP Architecture

- **Trigger.dev**  
  Used to schedule and orchestrate automated check-ins (morning, midday, evening, weekly).

- **Resend**  
  Used to deliver reflective prompts via email.

No dashboards.  
No analytics.  
Clarity comes from writing and reflection, not metrics.

## Check-in Flow

### Morning — Orientation

- Define a single intention for the day.
- Question:
  > What deserves my attention today?

---

### Midday — Recalibration

- Observe alignment without judgment.
- Questions:
  - Am I still aligned with my intention?
  - If not, what pulled me away?
  - What is the smallest correction I can make?

---

### Evening — Integration

- Convert effort into learning.
- Questions:
  - What did I actually do today?
  - What did I learn?
  - What should I stop repeating?

---

### Weekly — Decision

Each active commitment must be explicitly decided:

- Continue
- Pause
- Kill

Decisions reduce noise.  
Focus follows.

---

## Principles

- Attention is limited
- Fewer active commitments lead to better outcomes
- Reflection requires space, not speed
- Decisions must be explicit
- Systems should recenter, not judge

---

## Status

This project is actively used and evolving through daily personal practice.

The MVP intentionally remains minimal to preserve clarity and usability.
